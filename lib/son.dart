// Variables définissant le son du TTS

double volume = 1.0;
double pitch = 0.9;
double rate = 0.8;

// Speech rate. 1.0 is the normal speech rate, lower values slow down the speech (0.5 is half the normal speech rate),
// greater values accelerate it (2.0 is twice the normal speech rate).

// Speech pitch. 1.0 is the normal pitch, lower values lower the tone of the synthesized voice, greater values increase it.
